# 6-Bit Custom CPU Design With ALU, RAM, and ISA

This project presents the complete design and simulation of a custom **6-bit CPU architecture** developed as part of the **Computer Architecture Assignment**. The CPU includes a fully functional **ALU**, **Register Set**, **RAM**, **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**, and **Control Unit**.

## Key Features

* 6-bit word size CPU
* ALU operations: ADD, AND, SHL
* 6 general-purpose registers
* 9 × 18-bit RAM
* 18-bit instruction format
* Supports Register Mode, Immediate Mode, and Branching Instructions (JMP, JE)

## Components Implemented

* 6-bit ALU (Adder, AND, Shift Left)
* 6-bit Register Set with 6 registers
* 9 × 18 RAM module
* Program Counter and Control Unit
* Custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

## Sample Program

The design supports execution of machine-level instructions including arithmetic, logical, shift, and branch operations such as:

* ADD R1, 3
* AND R1, 0
* SHL R2, 2
* JMP and JE instructions

## Academic Purpose

This project is intended for educational demonstration of:

* CPU datapath construction
* Instruction decoding
* Memory interfacing
* Control signal generation
